D3 Tree Search Animation
========================

This D3 visualization shows a simple search in a tree based on a user's input. 
A user can select depth-first search or breadth-first search. The visualization
shows the nodes queued up (or stacked up) to be checked and the current node being
checked. Users can see this both in the graph animation and as text.
